Arcade Mode
	Succeeding in a certain game type should pause that game and begin another
	Use the Hat to pick out which game
	Maybe players should earn game jumps, and only activate them if they want
		This will allow module artists to tell their full story, uninterrupted
	Modules might need time to prepare a new game, or to generate game resources while they're sitting idly
		A module might need to alert the loader once it is ready
		A module that takes too long to do this should be discarded

Studio Mode
	Toolbar containing the icons of the games
		Also some other controls: color, clear, undo/redo
		File saving (menu similar to ScoreInput)
			Signature
			Drag'n'drop
	Ability to place a module over the canvas
		position (drag), rotation and isotropic scaling (scale border scale9grid)
		play button (circle) in the center
			Zoom in, play
			Escape, losing takes you back out

Module settings tab
	Clicking on a module shows its summary text and author text
		Possibly also shows module-specific settings
			Make TetrisSettingsView for Tetris module
	Delete button
		"Are you positive?" dialog, yes, no
			Give them the option to move the module file to the Desktop
		Grayed out for built-ins, and when game is being played
		Complete implementing lastMix
			When a module is deleted, lastMix must also be spliced, saved, etc.
			
	Drag&drop modules in
		"Poke with a stick" dialog
			If new module has the same name as an old module, bring up an overwrite alert
			Successful drop, module list is redrawn and new module is selected
			Unsuccessful drop, "That's not a module" dialog, retry, close
				Remember to delete failures
	SettingsMenu gets data from ModuleManager (similar to GridMenu)
		The entire module list
			Gets names, icons, versions and info blurbs (and reference to resetSettings())
		The entire module settings list
			Gets module settings

Debug menu
	
	"Stick around" checkbox
	Link to online developer resource
	Animated intro first time

				Editable Object hierarchy list thing
		Settings tester
			Settings panel on the left, scaled to proper dimensions
			Settings Object
				Selectable text block on the right, containing a description of the resulting settings object
			Generate button
		Module Approval
			Only allowed after module survives five minutes in the test chamber.
			First time around, congratulatory animation
				Go show your mom (secret)
			"Create EGM file" button

Get Controller to handle new modules
	Show prompt
	Refresh good loader list
	Refresh strategy, if necessary
	Refresh grid menu
	Success event:
		It gets appended to the main mix
		The Modules settings panel gets updated

Advanced debug error handling
	If a module doesn't work properly for some reason, a prompt shows up
		(already exists as a built-in, isn't a Module subclass, too large, too big onscreen)
		Listens for Module Loader timeout and alerts the dev
			Jesus Christ, how big is that thing?
				That's what she said.

Document everything
	Write an explanatory text file for net.rezmason.gui package
	Update class listings, include column that states whether class is intended for common use

Improve audio set

Deployment (by March 2009):
	Engram (AIR app)
		Buy a certificate later
			Get it from the Adobe marketplace!
		
	Modules (.EGM)
		Tetris module
		Breakout module
			Make this entirely outside of Flash CS3
		Some sort of art generation in both of 'em
		Some sort of blab in both of 'em

Gamepad Mode
	net.rezmason.gui.IGamepadTarget.compileGUITable(): 
		compile an array of gpChildren {gamepad-accessible child, child.getBounds(target)}
	(Selects current gpChild, tweens the GamepadOutline (scale9) around it)
		Menus need a default gpChild and a previous gpChild
	arrow keys direct focus / focal point to the next gpChild
		If a ray drawn in the indicated direction from the current focal point hits another gpChild, it becomes the next focus
		Otherwise, the gpChild closest to the current gpChild in the indicated direction gains focus; its center is the new focal point
	(A is a mouse click on the selected GUIAbstract, B is a mouse click on the default negative target)
	(Speeds up hex slider and menu sliders)
	(ScoreInput uses three-letter dial system instead of text box)
	Prompts user for a sequence of gamepad input
		Never mind
	Snipes the cursor (hides it)
		killMouse, reviveMouse
	"Guess you won't be needing that cursor anymore."
	"Let's face it; he was just using you."
	Gives a blurb about keypad use. Get it?
		Got it
