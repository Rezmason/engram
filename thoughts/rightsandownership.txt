Erin & Thesis project:

Experimental Game Design â€“ ask Ruiz about idea and independent study

How to keep the Bigwigs from ceasing Engram distribution

- Engram should cost no money and is intended to be open source and freely distributed
- Engram uses appropriation, which artists can get by with, but perhaps not colleges
- Presumably, the Engram community will need to be regularly moderated by a dedicated staff

- Keep the source code and materials

- RPI IP Policy for thesis projects: it's tradition to give me all the rights, thank you very much.
