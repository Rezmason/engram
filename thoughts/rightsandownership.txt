Erin & Thesis project:

Experimental Game Design â€“ ask Ruiz about idea and independent study

How to keep the Bigwigs from ceasing Engram distribution
	- Come to an agreement beforehand with game makers
		- Engram is a recognition of their games' impact on society

How to keep RPI from mishandling Engram
	
	- Engram is an art project and a community project
	- If RPI claims ownership, I should have the right to update the module and distribute it and its source code freely
	- If RPI claims ownership of a module, I should have the right to update the module and distribute it and its source code freely

	Points:
		- Engram should cost no money and is intended to be open source and freely distributed
		- Engram uses appropriation, which artists can get by with, but perhaps not colleges
		- Presumably, the Engram community will need to be regularly moderated by a dedicated staff

	- Keep the source code and materials
