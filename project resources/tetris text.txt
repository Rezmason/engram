So I met this guy, on my morning commute.

Every day, he'd slip and fall into this hole in the middle of the sidewalk. It was like clockwork.

One day I went up to him and said, "Why do you fall in this hole every day?"

He said, "I didn't know it was the same hole every day." Unbelievable, right?

I said, "Well, don't you see the hole, before you fall into it?" He said, "No."

"Well," I said, "if you really are that unaware, you're gonna keep falling into that hole."

And he was like, "What do you take me for? Magellan? I can't maneuver around every crack in the sidewalk."

"Clearly not," I said. "But even if you can't be aware of the world around you, you've still got to be self-aware. You've got to."

Well the next day, like for a solid week, he still fell into that stupid hole. But he was catching on.

The next week, he just barely avoided it. So that's how it went.

The last time I saw him, he made a turn onto a completely different street.

I can only guess at what crazy holes in uncharted sidewalks he may yet discover.
